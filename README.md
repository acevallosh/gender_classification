##Overview

I built a simple gender classification program on Python. The code uses scikit-learn machine learning library to train a small dataset of body metrics (heigh, weight, shoe size) labeled with "Male" or "Female". The program is able to predict the gender of another person, given a new set of body metrics.

##Dependencies
- Scikit-learn
- numpy
- scipy

##Usage
Run the script in terminal via
python demo.py
